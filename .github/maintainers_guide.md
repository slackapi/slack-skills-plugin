# Maintainers Guide

This document describes tools, tasks, and workflows needed to maintain the
`slackapi/slack-skills-plugin` repository. This is a skills plugin
marketplace, so the primary maintenance work is keeping skill content accurate
and plugin versions correct rather than managing build artifacts or package
registries.

## Tools

Maintaining this repo requires:

- **[Claude Code][claude-code]**: the primary development and maintenance tool.
  Most tasks (authoring skills, reviewing diffs) are performed through Claude
  Code rather than traditional CLI tooling.
- **[Cursor][cursor]**: an alternative agentic coding environment. Useful for
  verifying that skills and commands work outside Claude Code before release.
- **[Codex][codex-cli]**: another agentic coding environment. Useful for
  verifying that the skills work outside Claude Code before release.
- **[OpenCode][opencode]**: supports repository-local validation of the Slack
  MCP server, eight skills, and five namespaced commands.
- **Git**: standard version control.
- **[GitHub CLI (`gh`)][gh-cli]**: for creating PRs as drafts and managing
  issues.

### Python (and friends)

We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python runtime management. If you use macOS, follow the following steps:

```sh
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

Install necessary Python runtime for development/testing.

```sh
pyenv install 3.14 # select the latest patch version
pyenv local 3.14

pyenv rehash
```

Then, you can create a new Virtual Environment this way:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Authoring Skills

A skill's `description` frontmatter is the only text an agent reads when deciding whether to load the skill, so write it deliberately. For general skill-authoring mechanics (structure, naming, frontmatter, testing), invoke the `superpowers:writing-skills` skill; if it isn't installed, its frontmatter rules follow the [Agent Skills specification][agent-skills].

Every `description` in this repo follows these conventions:

1. **Lead with the trigger, not the pitch.** Open with "Use when …" and describe the situation that should load the skill, not what it can do.
2. **Don't summarize the workflow.** Listing what the skill covers is fine; a step-by-step of how it works is not, because an agent will follow the description instead of reading the skill body.
3. **Write impersonally.** No first person ("I can …") or second person ("You can also …"). State the condition, not the assistant.
4. **Pin the moment** with "before …" when the skill should fire at a specific point, e.g. before answering a question about Slack.
5. **Pack in concrete keywords** an agent would match on: method names (`chat.postMessage`), error strings (`missing_scope`), MCP tool names (`slack_send_message`), CLI commands (`slack run`), and URL shapes (`slack.com/api/…`).
6. **Name the Slack surface.** Say which part of Slack the trigger covers: Web API method, Block Kit modal, canvas, or channel search. Generic phrasing loses to a skill that names the surface.
7. **Keep it to a line or two.** A fragment, no marketing adjectives. Aim under 500 characters; the hard cap is 1024.

## Local Development & Testing

Before you release (or open a PR), exercise your changes locally: run the test
suite, and load the plugin into Claude Code or Cursor to try the skills and
commands by hand.

### Setup

Run the one-time setup, which creates the virtualenv and installs the test and
lint dependencies (requires Python 3.14+, see above):

```sh
make install
```

The tests read configuration from environment variables. Copy the example file
and fill in what you need. Each variable is documented inline, and the
`Makefile` auto-loads `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
# Set the environment variables
```

### Running the tests

Always use the `make` targets, never invoke `pytest`, `ruff`, `python`, or other tools
directly. The targets manage the virtualenv, load `.env`, and set up the test
dependencies for you.

Run `make help` to list every target with its description (read straight from the
`Makefile`, so it's always current). The ones you'll reach for most:

```sh
make help        # list all targets with their descriptions
make test-unit   # fast structural + frontmatter checks (this is what CI runs)
make test-eval   # LLM-judged skill evaluations (local only)
make test        # both
make lint        # Ruff (Python) + rumdl (Markdown) linter checks
make format      # Auto-format: Ruff for Python, rumdl --fix for Markdown
make typecheck   # Mypy static type checks
```

Markdown linting is powered by [rumdl](https://github.com/rvben/rumdl), a
markdownlint-compatible Rust linter. It validates the plugin's authored
markdown — `skills/`, `commands/`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the
contributor-facing `.github/` docs. Rules, disabled checks, and the `include`
list of linted files are configured under `[tool.rumdl]` in `pyproject.toml`;
tune that section when a new file or skill trips a rule that isn't worth
enforcing.

### Testing in Claude Code

Load your local changes into Claude Code for a single session with the
`--plugin-dir` flag:

```sh
claude --plugin-dir ./
```

This loads the `slack` plugin from your checkout: its skills and commands, and
the HTTP MCP server from `.mcp.json`. If you already have the published
`slack` plugin installed, the local copy takes precedence **for that session
only**: nothing is written to your settings, and the installed version is
untouched when you exit. After editing a skill or command, run `/reload-plugins`
inside the session to pick up the change without restarting.

Check the plugin's structure without launching a session:

```sh
claude plugin validate
```

### Testing in Cursor

Install the plugin into your local Cursor, then reload plugins in Cursor to pick
up the changes:

```sh
make cursor-install
```

This copies the plugin into `~/.cursor/plugins/slack@local` and registers it.

To remove it, run `make cursor-uninstall`. (`make clean` also runs the Cursor
uninstall, in addition to removing the virtualenv and other generated files.)

### Testing in Codex

Codex loads plugins only from a marketplace, and a marketplace source can be a local
directory, so your checkout serves as one. The repo ships the `slack` marketplace at
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, which is both the public listing and the local
marketplace root you point Codex at while developing.

From the repo root, register the checkout as a marketplace and install the plugin from it:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add ./
codex plugin add slack@slack
```

`codex plugin list` shows the plugin; `codex /plugins` opens the same flow interactively. Start a new Codex session to pick up the plugin, then invoke a skill by name with a `$` mention, for example `$block-kit`.

**Re-run `codex plugin add slack@slack` after every change.** Installing copies your
checkout into `~/.codex/plugins/cache/slack/slack/<version>/`, and Codex loads that copy
rather than reading your working tree, so edits do not show up on their own. Re-running
the install overwrites the copy in place, with no version bump required; start a new Codex
session and the change is live. The copy is taken from the working tree, so uncommitted
changes are picked up as-is and there is no need to commit first.

`codex plugin marketplace upgrade` will not do this for you. It only refreshes Git
marketplace snapshots, and errors on a marketplace added from a local path.

To remove it

```sh
codex plugin remove slack@slack
codex plugin marketplace remove slack
```

Codex resolves marketplace manifests from four hard-coded relative paths, so a
separate `marketplace.dev.json` is not an option. Working on the plugin locally is
handled by pointing Codex at your checkout, as above, rather than by shipping a
second manifest.

Codex support currently ships only the skills; the hosted MCP server is not yet wired into the Codex surface.

### Testing in OpenCode

The plugin supports OpenCode 2 and OpenCode 1 (1.18.29 or newer) from one
package. Load it from the git-backed spec in the OpenCode config's `plugins`
array (`plugin` on OpenCode 1):

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "slack@git+https://github.com/slackapi/slack-skills-plugin.git"
  ]
}
```

`package.json` points `main` and `exports` at `.opencode/plugins/slack.js`, whose
default export carries both entrypoints:

- OpenCode 2 reads `id` and `setup` (from `.opencode/plugins/opencode-v2.js`).
  OpenCode 2 has no global `config` hook, so `setup` registers the eight skills
  through `ctx.skill.transform`, the five `slack-*` commands through
  `ctx.command.transform`, and the Slack MCP server through `ctx.mcp.transform`.
- OpenCode 1 calls `server()`, which returns the native `config` hook. Skill
  discovery there uses `config.skills.paths`, which is not present in the public
  1.18 type; keep this runtime-verified compatibility assumption isolated to the
  plugin and its focused tests.

Both paths leave `skills/` and `commands/` as the authoritative sources and
create no filesystem state. Registration is idempotent, and an existing `slack`
MCP server is preserved rather than overwritten.

The MCP OAuth configuration uses these non-secret fields (OpenCode 2 shape;
OpenCode 1 receives `clientId` and `redirectUri`):

```json
{
  "type": "remote",
  "url": "https://mcp.slack.com/mcp",
  "oauth": {
    "client_id": "{env:SLACK_OPENCODE_CLIENT_ID}",
    "redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:19876/mcp/oauth/callback",
    "callback_port": 19876
  }
}
```

Never commit or print Slack client IDs, client secrets, or tokens. For app
eligibility, scopes, PKCE, and OAuth setup, follow the README.

#### Plugin registration validation

Run the focused OpenCode registration tests with the normal unit target:

```sh
make test-unit
```

The tests cover both entrypoints: registration, discoverability, command names,
remote MCP fields, idempotency, collision preservation, and credential safety.

For a read-only smoke test, use an eligible internal Slack app configured as
described in the README. Enable MCP server access from the app's **App
Assistant** page before authenticating. Export only your local client ID; never
record it in the repository or command output captured in an issue or PR.

```sh
export SLACK_OPENCODE_CLIENT_ID="your-app-client-id"
opencode service restart
opencode api get /api/plugin -H "X-OpenCode-Directory: $PWD"
opencode mcp list
opencode
```

Confirm the plugin response contains `slack.skills` with status `active`, then sign in to `slack` from
`/mcps` and confirm the MCP list reports it connected. Check that the eight
canonical skills and the five `slack-*` commands are available. In the interactive session, invoke a read-only command such as
`/slack-summarize-channel` against a non-sensitive test channel and ask OpenCode
to use `slack-search` without sending messages, adding reactions, creating
channels, or modifying canvases. If MCP access was enabled after an earlier
authorization, run `opencode mcp logout slack` and sign in again.

## Versioning

Follow the [conventional commit specification][conv-commits]. PR titles and commit messages use prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc. First letter after the prefix is lowercase unless it's a proper noun.

### Updating Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to track changes and automate releases.

Each changeset describes a change to the package and its [semver][semver] impact, and a new changeset should be added when updating the package with some change that affects consumers:

```sh
npx changeset add
```

Alternatively, hand-write a file named `.changeset/<anything>.md`, with this format:

```md
---
"slack": minor
---

Add the channel-digest command
```

The frontmatter key is always `"slack"`; the value is the [semver][semver] bump level, like `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. The body becomes the changelog entry, so write it for a reader of the release notes.

Updates to documentation, tests, or CI might not require new entries.

When a PR containing changesets is merged to `main`, a different PR is opened or updated using [changesets/action](https://github.com/changesets/action) which consumes the pending changesets, bumps the package version, and updates the `CHANGELOG` in preparation to release.

### Releases

Releasing can feel intimidating at first, but don't fret! Venture on!

New official package versions are published when the release PR created from changesets is merged. Follow these steps to build confidence:

1. **Run the tests locally**: Before merging the release PR please run all the tests (see [Local Development & Testing](#local-development--testing)), especially the eval ones. If they no longer pass we may need fix it before releasing the changes.

2. **Check GitHub**: Please check if issues or pull requests are still open either decide to postpone the release or save those changes for a future update.

3. **Review the release PR**: Verify that the version bump matches expectations, `CHANGELOG` entries are clear, and CI checks pass.

4. **Merge and approve**: Merge the release PR. It may take up to 24 hours before you see you release in the [Claude Plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/slack) directory.

5. **Communicate the release**: A Slack announcement is posted automatically to the release-announcements channel by `.github/workflows/release.yml` when the release PR is merged and a tag is cut. For broader outreach (e.g. `#tools-bolt` on [Slack Community](https://community.slack.com/)), post manually if desired.

## Everything Else

### CODEOWNERS

Owners are defined in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](CODEOWNERS). Any PR to this repo automatically requests review from this team.

### Dependabot

Dependabot is configured for GitHub Actions dependencies only (daily cadence).
Patch and minor updates are auto-approved and auto-merged via the
`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml` workflow.

### Issue Triage

- Bug reports about incorrect Block Kit output should be investigated by
  checking whether the relevant live `docs.slack.dev` page has changed.
- Feature requests for new skills should be discussed in the issue before
  implementation begins.
- Labels:
  - `bug`: confirmed defects
  - `enhancement`: feature requests and new functionality
  - `docs`: documentation-only changes
  - `test`: test-only changes
  - `build`: CI, GitHub Actions, and build/compilation processes
  - `chore`: repo structure, required files, release scaffolding, general maintenance
  - `dependencies`: dependency updates (Dependabot applies this automatically)
  - `security`: vulnerability fixes, hardening, and security audit findings
    (apply alongside `bug`/`build`/`dependencies` as appropriate)
