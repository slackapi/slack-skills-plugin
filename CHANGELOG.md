# slack

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c17458c: Sharpen the slack-messaging and slack-search skill guidance: clearer trigger descriptions, accurate standard-markdown formatting rules (tables, headers, code blocks), more search modifiers and parameters, and scope notes linking to related skills.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 937e74b: Add a Codex plugin surface. A new `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest exposes the Slack skills to [Codex][codex], and a repo-scoped `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` lets you install the plugin into Codex from a local checkout. The hosted MCP server is not yet wired into the Codex surface; skills only for now.

- 5a6f612: Route general Slack documentation questions to the slack-docs skill. The slack-cli skill's docs search is now scoped to terminal-based lookups via `slack docs search`, removing the overlap with slack-docs.

### Patch Changes

- c4caf79: Add rumdl Markdown linting to `make lint`/`make format` and clean up formatting across the skill and command docs.
- f716403: Align the install-surface metadata across the Claude Code and Cursor plugin manifests. Refresh the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` description, add a `repository` field to both manifests, point `homepage` at the `docs.slack.dev` developer hub, and add the JSON Schema reference to the Claude Code manifest for editor validation.
- 3906698: Automate release announcements to the internal maintainers' Slack channel from the release workflow.
- a3295d4: Teach the `block-kit` skill to preview blocks with the new `slack blocks preview` CLI command, which opens the Block Kit Builder with the blocks pre-loaded. The skill discovers the command's usage via `--help` rather than hard-coding flags, and falls back to the manual Block Kit Builder link when the CLI isn't installed. Also removes the redundant validation Escape Hatch, whose visual-debugging fallback is now covered by the richer preview step.
- 7bd09ea: Drop the `--experiment=sandboxes` flag from `slack sandbox` invocations in the `create-slack-app` skill. The experiment has been removed from `slack-cli`, so the flag now surfaces an unknown-experiment warning that can confuse users and agents.
- 9ea300a: Fix the `homepage` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to point to this repository instead of `slackapi/slack-mcp-cursor-plugin`, which does not exist and returned a 404.
- 9635a2f: Publish GitHub Releases from the release workflow so each tag has release notes.
- 46f5c53: Update the `homepage` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and repo links in docs to point to `slackapi/slack-skills-plugin`, the repository's new name.
