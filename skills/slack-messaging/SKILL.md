# Slack Messaging Best Practices

This skill provides guidance for composing well-formatted, effective Slack messages.

## When to Use

Apply this skill whenever composing, drafting, or helping the user write a Slack message, including when using `slack_send_message`, `slack_send_message_draft`, or `slack_schedule_message`. The formatting rules below cover these message tools. `slack_create_canvas` uses a different, richer markdown dialect — see the Canvas note below.

## Connector Attribution

Some AI hosts append a sender attribution such as “Sent using ChatGPT” after a message sent through a connected Slack tool. That footer is added by the host, is not part of the message text the user reviewed, and may not be removable by editing the message afterward.

- Apply this preflight only immediately before a real post or scheduled post. Do not show it for compose-only or rewrite-only work, or for `slack_send_message_draft`; those actions do not send.
- When the current host is known to add an attribution, stop and ask the user to choose between sending with the attribution or receiving final text to paste directly in Slack. Do not call the send or schedule tool until they choose. This matters especially when they say “as me,” use a mass mention, or are writing to customers.
- If attribution-free delivery matters, prepare the final text and have the user paste or send it directly in Slack instead of calling the send tool.
- Do not add the attribution to the drafted text yourself, and do not promise that a later edit can remove a host-added footer.

## Formatting

The message tools (`slack_send_message`, `slack_send_message_draft`, `slack_schedule_message`) accept **standard markdown** and convert it to Slack formatting on send. Write normal markdown. Do **not** use Slack's legacy `mrkdwn` syntax (`*bold*`, `~strike~`); those single-character forms mean something different in standard markdown. Each text element is limited to ~5000 characters.

| Format        | Syntax                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Bold          | `**text**`             |
| Italic        | `_text_` (or `*text*`) |
| Strikethrough | `~~text~~`             |
| Code (inline) | `` `code` ``           |
| Quote         | `> text`               |
| Link          | `[display text](url)`  |
| Bulleted list | `- item`               |
| Numbered list | `1. item`              |

Block elements also work. Write them as literal markdown:

- **Code block** with an optional language for syntax highlighting:

  ````text
  ```python
  print("hello")
  ```
  ````

- **Table** with `|` delimiters (escape a literal pipe inside a cell as `\|`):

  ```text
  | Feature | Status |
  |---------|--------|
  | Tables  | works  |
  ```

- **Headers** with `#` / `##` / `###`:

  ```text
  ## Section title
  ```

The one thing that does **not** embed in a message: inline images (`![alt](url)`) typically render as a plain link rather than an inline image. For rich embedded layouts (buttons, images, structured cards) you need Block Kit; for a document-style surface where images do embed, use a canvas. See the Notes below.

## Message Structure Guidelines

- **Lead with the point.** Put the most important information in the first line. Many people read Slack on mobile or in notifications where only the first line shows.
- **Keep it short.** Aim for 1-3 short paragraphs (the ~5000-character limit is a ceiling, not a target). If the message is long or structured, consider a Canvas instead.
- **Use line breaks generously.** Walls of text are hard to read. Separate distinct thoughts with blank lines.
- **Use bullet points for lists.** Anything with 3+ items should be a list, not a run-on sentence.
- **Bold key information.** Use `**bold**` for names, dates, deadlines, and action items so they stand out when scanning.

## Thread vs. Channel Etiquette

- **Reply in threads** when responding to a specific message to keep the main channel clean.
- **Use `reply_broadcast`** (also post to channel) only when the reply contains information everyone needs to see.
- **Post in the channel** (not a thread) when starting a new topic, making an announcement, or asking a question to the whole group.
- **Don't start a new thread** to continue an existing conversation; find and reply to the original message.

## Tone and Audience

- Match the tone to the channel: `#general` is usually more formal than `#random`.
- For simple acknowledgments, add an emoji reaction with `slack_add_reaction` instead of a reply message (use `slack_get_reactions` to read existing reactions).
- When writing announcements, use a clear structure: context, key info, call to action.

## Scheduling

- Use `slack_schedule_message` to post later. `post_at` is a Unix timestamp that must be at least 2 minutes in the future and at most 120 days out; the message body uses the same standard markdown as above.
- Scheduled messages can't be edited via the API once set — the user manages them from **Drafts & sent** in Slack.

## Notes

- **Canvas formatting is different.** `slack_create_canvas` uses Canvas-flavored Markdown, a richer dialect than the message tools: headers, tables, checklists, and inline images (`![alt](url)`) all embed, and it also supports user/channel reference cards, callouts, and columns. Do **not** assume the message rules above apply — follow the `slack_create_canvas` tool's own formatting guidance when composing a canvas.
- **Scope:** this skill owns composing and formatting the _text_ of messages sent through the Slack MCP message tools. For interactive layouts (buttons, menus, modals, Home tabs, or any Block Kit JSON), use the `slack:block-kit` skill, which composes and validates the block payload. For calling the Slack Web API directly (`chat.postMessage` and friends) rather than the MCP tools, use the `slack:slack-api` skill.
